Well, they finally got<BR>tired of dragging you around, and so<BR>they dumped you in a conveniently-placedbarrow and went off to get some ale<BR>before the pubs closed...
18b4: Location 1:
      You are inside an old barrow deep withinthe forest. To the south there is a<BR>cracked and deterioated marble archway<BR>over which is posed a sign reading:<BR>"Werner's Dungeon - Western Annexe".
1970: Location 2:
      You are in the cloak-room of the westernannexe. As you might have guessed, this<BR>is the room in which the visitors are<BR>supposed to hang their cloaks. As you<BR>are wearing no such apparel, you are<BR>unable to use this room for its intended<BR>purpose. Other visitors, however, have<BR>done so, and thus there are some cloaks<BR>hanging on the walls. The sole exit is<BR>to the east.
1add: Location 3:
      You are at a junction in the western<BR>annexe of Werner's Dungeon. Passages<BR>lead in all directions.
1b3f: Location 4:
      You are in the gift shop of the western<BR>annexe. This gift shop is, unlike the<BR>one in Werner's Quest part I, not<BR>deserted; an ogre is sitting behind the<BR>counter, eyeing you suspiciously. Taped<BR>to the counter is a note. A passage<BR>leads west.
1c2f: Location 5:
      You are in a small room carved out of<BR>the rock. All four walls are covered<BR>with adventure game maps. One map<BR>particularly catches your eye: A large<BR>one with only two squares, one marked<BR>"P", the other marked "Q". A ladder<BR>leads down.
1d19: Location 6:
      You are in a square room with yellow,<BR>translucent walls. On the eastern wall<BR>is a large, faintly gray circle, as if<BR>there once had been a large black circlewhich now is erased. A ladder leads up.
1ddd: Location 7:
      You are in a small library which, not<BR>unexpectedly, contains bookcases, which,not unexpectedly, contain books. On one<BR>wall hangs a sign reading:<BR>"The Werner library of the world's<BR>thinnest books". The books have titles<BR>like: "Prominent Norwegians", "Scottish<BR>Charity Funds", "Good Spectrum Games"<BR>and the like. A leaflet, entitled<BR>"Poems which help you complete Werner's<BR>Quest II" is lying on a small table. Theexit is to the east.
1f8d: Location 8:
      You are in the lobby of the western<BR>annexe. Passages lead in all directions.The lobby is furnished with large plush<BR>sofas and an eminent grandfather clock,<BR>which is big enough to enter. On one<BR>wall hangs a once-neon-lit sign, which<BR>is now out of order and cannot be read.
209d: Location 9:
      You are standing inside a large grand-<BR>father clock. A red button is right in<BR>front of your face, almost asking you<BR>to press it.
211e: Location 10:
      You are in the Lost &amp; Found dept. of thewestern annexe. The walls are covered<BR>with dusty shelves, all of which are<BR>empty. The exit is to the the west.
21b5: Location 11:
      You are in a passage turning south and<BR>east. A ladder leads up through a hole<BR>in the ceiling and down through a<BR>similar hole in the floor. 
2241: Location 12:
      You are in an east-west passage. To the<BR>south is a magnificient mahogany<BR>doorway over which is hung an equally<BR>magnificient mahogany sign bearing the<BR>somewhat less magnificient inscription:<BR>"Broom Closet".
230f: Location 13:
      You are in a circular room with doorwaysleading in all directions. A note taped<BR>to one of the walls reads: "De room-<BR>spinnuh are regrettubly out of order.<BR><BR>     De Thing-Fish"
23bf: Location 14:
      You are in a room whose only remarkable<BR>feature is a large stone door over whichis it written:<BR>    "What Is It,<BR>       That Some Folks<BR>         Like Better<BR>           But For Which<BR>             The Muffin Man,<BR>               For One,<BR>                 Cares Less?"<BR>The exit lies to the west.
24e2: Location 15:
      You are in the tea room of an obviously-deranged hatter. You know this because alarge sign on one wall reads:<BR>"The tea room of an obviously-deranged<BR>hatter". The exit is west and the only<BR>piece of furniture is an oblong table.
25c5: Location 16:
      You are in a broom closet. There are no<BR>brooms here, however, as they have been<BR>tossed out to make room for something<BR>else. The exit is north.
2654: Location 17:
      You are in the entry hall of the Muffin<BR>Utility Research Kitchen (MURK). There<BR>is a desk here and, behind it, a<BR>sleeping gnome, snoring loudly.<BR>A passage leads north and there is a<BR>doorway in the eastern wall.
2726: Location 18:
      You are in the laboratory of the Muffin<BR>Utility Research Kitchen (MURK). It is<BR>full of strange machinery mixed with<BR>common household items. The Muffin Man<BR>is seated at a table.
27d7: Location 19:
      You are standing at the bottom of a hugestaircase leading up. A passage leads<BR>north and a by no means insignificant<BR>crack leads east.
285d: Location 20:
      You are standing in the northern end of a narrow ledge overlooking a deep<BR>canyon. An uninsignificant crack leads<BR>west.
28d4: Location 21:
      You are in a small and totally feature-<BR>less room. The only break in the<BR>complete and utter monotony of this roomis the southern wall, which consists of<BR>a curtain of light.
2981: Location 22:
      You are standing on the top of an<BR>impressive staircase leading downwards.<BR>The staircase ends here in a blank wall,obviously the result of an effort made<BR>by a severely-stupid architect. However,a recent cave-in has produced a narrow<BR>crack to the east.
2a7c: Location 23:
      You are in a small chamber whose only<BR>exit is the narrow crack (which has beenproduced by a recent cave-in) in the<BR>western wall. This is, of course, an<BR>extremely stupid arrangement, as nobody<BR>could enter this room before the above-<BR>mentioned cave-in. Places like this are<BR>only found in badly structured adventuregames. Therefore, to make this silly<BR>room somewhat more logical, there is<BR>also an opening in the floor, through<BR>which you, far below, can see the bottomof a canyon.
2c59: Location 24:
      You are in a furniture shop in Bolton.<BR>To the north there is the curtain dept.,in which one curtain, namely the one<BR>through which you entered, is especiallyconspicuous, as it is made of light.
2d1a: Location 25:
      You are in the viewing room of the<BR>Werner Dungeon Bank. To the south is thepompous bank entrance, and to the north<BR>is a curtain of light.
2da4: Location 26:
      You are in the soft room. This room is<BR>very soft. It is much more soft than thesoft room in Colossal Caves, and a fair<BR>deal softer than the soft room in the   Very Big Cave Adventure. This should be<BR>enough to make you understand that this<BR>room is indeed very very very very soft.The rug, for example, is so soft that<BR>movement within this room should be<BR>referred to as wading rather than<BR>walking. The entire room is equally<BR>soft, and the room description is prettysoft, too. You might be able to leave<BR>the room by wading to the east.
2fb9: Location 27:
      You are standing in the middle of a<BR>narrow ledge in a ravine. On the other<BR>side of the ravine is another ledge.<BR>High above, in the ceiling of the cave,<BR>is an opening. A passage leads west, andto the south is a location whose room<BR>description mainly consists of a very<BR>poor pun.
30cf: Location 28:
      You are on a narrow ledge in a ravine.<BR>High above, you can see an opening in<BR>the rock ceiling. You can go east<BR>through a large doorway, over which is<BR>written in ugly runes:<BR>"The Werner Dungeon Bank".
3197: Location 29:
      You are in the entrance hall of the<BR>Werner Dungeon Bank. Big portraits line the walls, and above a door leading<BR>north is a sign in gothic lettering<BR>reading: "Viewing Room". The exit lies<BR>to the west and a passage leads east.
3278: Location 30:
      You are in a small room which would havebeen featureless if there hadn't been a<BR>lever protruding from one wall, and a<BR>large sign next to it reading:<BR>"Any attempt to push, hit, break, get,<BR>drop, wear, doff, read, press, turn,<BR>bribe, converse with, shout at, inhale, eat, drink, give, throw, insert, climb,<BR>enter, stand on, inflate, deflate,<BR>exhale, attack, cut, paste, plant,<BR>shoot, flush, wash, wave, rub, twist,<BR>light or extinguish this lever will<BR>inevitably lead to THE DEATH PENALTY!".<BR>The exit lies to the east.
347c: Location 31:
      You are in another useless room, a pass-<BR>age, which has been thrown in only to<BR>increase the number of locations in thisadventure. This east-west unnecessity<BR>has yet another abundant corridor<BR>emerging from it, namely one to the<BR>south.
3566: Location 32:
      You are standing at the south end of a<BR>narrow ledge. To the west is a passage<BR>entering the bedrock. Since this room<BR>serves no real purpose in the adventure,why not use it for a cheap Leather-<BR>Goddesses-of-Phobos-Dock-type pun:<BR>The Ledge-End Of The Amazon Women.
366c: Location 33:
      You are standing in front of a huge,<BR>cerise door. A passage leads north.
36b5: Location 34:
      You are in a circular room knee-deep<BR>with a strange, purple, semi-diaphanous<BR>Jell-O. The exit, up a few steps, lies<BR>to the north.
3737: Location 35:
      You are standing before a huge door<BR>bearing a inscription in golden runes:<BR>"Werner's Quest part III". Next to the<BR>door stands a bearded man wearing a<BR>green uniform encumbered with golden<BR>shoulder-straps and facings. Carried by<BR>the man is a large briefcase out of<BR>which flows vast amount of white smoke. He says: "Hello advenzurer! My name is<BR>Rance ze Dungeonkeeper. I suppose zat<BR>you vish to enter Werner's Kvest part<BR>zree, as you have come here. Vat is ze<BR>password?"
390b: Location 36:
      You are in a passage turning north and<BR>east. An arrow pointing north is marked:"To Werner's Quest part III".
3978: Location 37:
      You are in the residence of Kebaberus,<BR>the legendary three-headed giant mutant<BR>dachshund-guard of the southern exit. A passage leads west and to the south is  the southern exit.
3a2a: Location 38:
      You are in an oddly-angled room. In the<BR>floor is set a small diamond-shaped<BR>window through which you can see<BR>cheaters and liars.

3cb8: Location 43:
      You are in an oddly-angled room. In the<BR>floor is set a small diamond-shaped<BR>window through which you can see snakes<BR>in the grass.
3d3a: Location 44:
      You are in an oddly-angled room. In the<BR>floor is set a small diamond-shaped<BR>window through which you can see<BR>tricksters and traitors.
3dc0: Location 45:
      You are in an oddly-angled room. In the<BR>floor is set a small diamond-shaped<BR>window through which you can see<BR>landrats and lifters.
3e43: Location 46:
      You are in an oddly-angled room. In the<BR>floor is set a small diamond-shaped<BR>window through which you can see<BR>arsonists in hoods.
3ec4: Location 47:
      You are in an oddly-angled room.
3ee5: Location 48:
      You are in a cave. From some scribblings<BR>on one of the walls, reading "Arthur<BR>Dent was here", you conclude that ArthurDent has been in this cave. Upon furtherreflection, you assume that this is the<BR>cave in which Arthur Dent once spent<BR>five years. In one corner lies a pile<BR>of furs. The exit is west.
4011: Location 49:
      You are in the northern end of the<BR>canyon bottom. To the east is a small<BR>cave.
4060: Location 50:
      You are in the southern end of the<BR>canyon bottom. To the west is a round<BR>hole in the rock wall.
40c0: Location 51:
      You are in room filled with debris<BR>washed from the ceiling. On one of the<BR>walls, the word "XYZZY" is carved with<BR>crude runes. The room once had exits to<BR>the east and west, but they are now<BR>blocked by debris.
4190: Location 52:
      You are standing inside a large grand-<BR>father clock. A red button is right in<BR>front of your face, almost asking you<BR>to press it.
4211: Location 53:
      You are in a small small brick building.This place gives you a faint sense of<BR>Deja Vu. You feel, however, that<BR>something is missing. Suddenly it<BR>strikes you: The well is missing. The<BR>floor, in which the well should be<BR>positioned, consists only of wooden<BR>planks.
4317: Location 54:
      You are in the office of Level 9 Soft-<BR>ware. The walls are hung with posters<BR>depicting the packages of various L9<BR>adventures. A grandfather clock stands<BR>in one corner, and behind the desk sits<BR>no other than Pete Austin.
